== Early years ==
Stoner was born in 1899 in Bowie, Texas. He grew up in a family of 17 children. His given name was "Ulysses Simpson Grant Stoner", a reference to the 18th President of the United States. His brothers, Benjamin Franklin Stoner, Theodore Roosevelt Stoner, and Washington Irving Stoner, were also named after famous Americans.Stoner acquired his nickname when a younger sister could not pronounce his given name, Ulysses, and instead began calling him "Lil". Stoner later recalled of the nickname, "It stuck as I grew up."In 1913, at age 14, he pitched for the South Side Baptist Church of Fort Worth, Texas, in the Twilight League. He gained acclaim when, at age 14, and while still wearing short pants, he pitched a shutout game against a team of adults. His family later moved to Okmulgee, Oklahoma, where he played semi-professional baseball for the Empire Refining Company team. With Stoner pitching, Empire Refining won the Oklahoma championship in 1918 and 1919.

=== Minor leagues ===
Stoner began his professional baseball career in 1919 with the Oklahoma City Indians of the Western League. He compiled a 12–15 win–loss record in 1919 and remained with Oklahoma City for three seasons. He finished the 1921 season with the Okmulgee Drillers of the Western Association.


=== The sharp breaking curve ===
Stoner was known for combining "a terrific fast ball with exceptional control" and "a sharp breaking curve". Mark Koenig of the New York Yankees recalled that "Stoner had one of the best curve balls in the league." He was also called a "smokeball artist" for the speed with which he threw the baseball.The unusual movement on Stoner's breaking ball has been attributed to an injury sustained when he was a toddler. The index finger on his throwing hand was severed in a wood-chopping accident and left "hanging by a piece of flesh." The doctor bandaged the finger which reattached itself, but crookedly, a deformity that was credited with allowing Stoner to throw the ball with unusual movement.

In 1922, Stoner joined the Detroit Tigers. He made his major league debut in a losing effort against the Cleveland Indians on April 15, 1922.

On June 28, 1926, Stoner gave up a massive home run by Babe Ruth. The ball went over the right-center field wall and was estimated to have traveled between 600 and 626 feet. It was the longest home run of Ruth's career and in 1965 was referred to as "probably the longest home run ever hit in Detroit."In 1927, Stoner's ERA dropped by 1.5 points to a career-low 3.98, and he appeared in a career-high 38 games for the Tigers, including 24 starts.

Pitching for Forth Worth in the second half of the season, he compiled a 6–4 record and a career-low 2.00 ERA.In mid-September 1929, the Pittsburgh Pirates purchased Stoner from Fort Worth. He began the 1930 season with the Pirates but pitched only 5-2/3 regular seasons innings for the club, compiling a 4.76 ERA.

The release left Stoner out of work for the first time in 15 years. He was then signed by the Omaha Packers of the Western League where he won four straight games with no losses. At the end of June, and based on his showing at Omaha, Stoner was purchased by the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League. He was released by Houston in August 1932.Stoner signed with the Tulsa Oilers prior to the 1933 season. but he was given an outright release by that club on April 24, 1933.

In 1939 and 1940, Stoner played semi-pro ball for the Enid Champlins of Enid, Oklahoma.


== Family and later years ==
In August 1940, at age 41, Stoner announced his retirement from baseball in order to allow him to devote his full time to a job with the oil refinery that sponsored the Enid semi-pro club.Because of his love of baking and cooking, Stoner was sometimes known during his playing career as the "Bowie Baker Boy". He had worked at a bakery in Fort Worth, Texas, starting at age 16. In 1929, a nationally-syndicated newspaper story called Stoner the "Best Cook in Baseball" and a "culinary artist." According to the report, his cooking was the envy of the women of Okmulgee. The crowning achievement of his off-season after the 1928 season was a three-tiered birthday cake made of orange sponge cake "ornamented with green icing and lavishly decorated with paper leaves and flowers."Stoner was also an avid grower of irises and was an accredited judge of the American Iris Society. His "proudest botanical accomplishment" was his creation of "a pink iris hybrid." He was also a fan of the opera and amassed a large collection of opera records.Stoner died following a six-day hospitalization in Enid, Oklahoma in June 1966. He was 67 years old when he died. He was buried at Enid Memorial Park.With the popularization of the word "stoner" in cannabis culture, Stoner has seen a resurgence of popularity. In 2015, baseball writer Grant Brisbee picked "Lil Stoner" as the best presidential-inspired nickname in baseball history. Brisbee wrote: "A supremely unique, fantastic, and awesome name. A magnificent, evocative, delightful name." He speculated that, if Stoner played in contemporary times, "jersey sales would shoot through the roof." In 2017, a poll by Ranker received more than 13,000 votes and placed Stoner at No. 9 on its list of "The Best Baseball Names of All Time".
